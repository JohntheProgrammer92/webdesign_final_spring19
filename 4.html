            With both phone calls and internet calling available, smart phones give flexibility in communication styles
            There are too many apps to count that allow for voice over internet protocol (VOIP) calls 
            Even if a user doesnâ€™t have access to a standalone phone network, if internet is available through a wifi connection, calls can still be made.   
        </p>

            Text-based messaging is easier than ever on a modern smart phone.
            With full keyboards and autocorrect, typing an email or les formal text message is easy and fast.
            Voice dictation has also improved tremendously with AI assistants on smart phone          
        </p>

        <p>
            Some smartphones also offer scheduled texts and automatic replies.
            Being able to schedule a text message will assist those who need to be precise in communicating at certain times.
            Having automatic replies enabled outside of the office allows users to focus on the reason they are not in the office that day.
