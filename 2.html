          Having on the go internet access allows people to find new recipes and diet information anywhere, even in the kitchen. 
          There are many resources online for recipes and guides for cooking. Having a full computer in the kitchen is not practical. So, the portability of the smart phone also comes into play in this scenario. 
          The availability of health-related resources by trusted and knowledgeable providers means that waiting to speak to a professional in person once a week or less, is not the only way to check up on information about diet and food.

            Being able to look up reference material for infrequently used skills enables users to stay up to date without formal training. 
            For example, in the computer programming field, when a coding language is created it is completely documented on the source website for use by all who are learning it. 
            Often in the case of vehicles there are lesser known facts that aren’t necessarily professional knowledge that can be found online easily such: intended tire pressure, or oil type.
